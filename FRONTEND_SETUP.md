### If the React setup has issues:
- Make sure Node.js is installed (version 14 or higher)
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

### If your backend isn't working:
- Check that your `.env` file is properly configured
- Ensure your Canva API credentials are correct
- Verify the server is running on port 3001
