# Design Manager

A professional, modern web app for managing your Canva designs and folders with full OAuth integration, subfolder support, and a beautiful, responsive UI.

## Motivation

Canva is an excellent tool for content creation, but for power users, freelancers, and teams managing hundreds of designs, its native organizational tools can become a significant bottleneck. Finding specific assets can be time-consuming and frustrating. `Design Manager` was built to solve this problem by providing a dedicated, professional-grade interface for organizing, locating, and managing Canva assets at scale.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Material-UI (MUI)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **API Integration:** Canva Connect API, OAuth 2.0 PKCE
- **Development Workflow:** Concurrently

## Features

- **OAuth Authentication** with Canva
- **Folder & Subfolder Management** (create, delete, organize)
- **Design Management** (view, move, remove designs)
- **Recursive Design Counts** (parent folders show total designs in all descendants)
- **Responsive, Modern UI** (inspired by Canva)
- **Real-time Updates** (no page reloads needed)
- **Robust Error Handling**
